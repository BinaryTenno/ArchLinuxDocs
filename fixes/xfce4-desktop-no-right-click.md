# XFCE Desktop Freeze

After login the desktop is forzen. The wallpaper from lightdm remains on the desktop and there is no ability to right click.

A quick search leads to this website: https://www.fosslicious.com/2019/09/fix-xfce-desktop-error-cant-right-click.html

The guide suggests that running the `xfdesktop` command fixes the desktop and wallpaper. And upon reboot the issue will be fixed entirely.
